I'm a senior programmer with a real passion for... write code and learning new things.

This pages collects info on my home projects (nothing to do with real office work, where I work on linux-based embedded systems used in trasportation systems).

Currently I'm exploring modern (for me...) web development technologies trying to realize [a site][girelloni] to collect and share trekking experiences.

I'm also editor of the [Girelloni.net blog][girelloni-blog] (in italian language).
